## Customer Churn Prediction: A Comprehensive Analysis

### 1. Introduction

#### What is Customer Churn?

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company or service. In the context of this analysis, it specifically refers to telecom customers discontinuing their service.

#### Why is Churn Prediction Important?

Predicting customer churn is crucial for businesses as it allows them to identify at-risk customers proactively and implement retention strategies. Retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, directly impacting a company's profitability and sustainability. This project aims to build a robust model to accurately predict customer churn in a telecom dataset.

### 2. Data Acquisition and Initial Overview

#### What Data Was Used?

The analysis utilized a telecom customer churn dataset downloaded from Kaggle Hub ("abdullah0a/telecom-customer-churn-insights-for-analysis").

#### How Was the Data Loaded?

The `customer_churn_data.csv` file was loaded into a pandas DataFrame using `pd.read_csv()`.

#### What is the Initial Shape of the Dataset?

After loading, the dataset contained 7043 rows and 21 columns, indicating a substantial amount of customer information.

### 3. Data Preparation and Preprocessing

#### What Steps Were Taken for Data Quality?

- **Duplicate Removal**: All duplicate rows were removed to ensure each customer observation was unique. This reduced the dataset to 7043 rows and 21 columns, indicating no duplicate rows were initially present.
- **Missing Value Imputation**: Missing values in categorical (`object`) columns were imputed using the mode (most frequent value) of each respective column. This ensures that no data points are lost due to missing entries and that the dataset is complete for modeling.

#### How Were Outliers Handled?

Outliers in numerical columns were detected using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. A summary of outlier counts for each numerical column was generated. Box plots were visualized for columns identified with outliers to understand their distribution better. While outliers were detected and visualized, no explicit outlier removal or transformation strategy was applied to these specific instances beyond the log transformation for skewed data.

#### How Were Data Types Converted?

A comprehensive type conversion process was applied:

- **Categorical (Object) Columns**: Converted to numerical representations using `LabelEncoder`. This is essential for machine learning models that require numerical input.
- **Datetime Columns**: Converted into a numerical format representing days since the earliest date in the column.
- **Boolean Columns**: Converted to integers (True became 1, False became 0).
  These conversions ensure all data is in a suitable numerical format for machine learning algorithms.

### 4. Feature Engineering and Scaling

#### What New Features Were Created?

A new feature, `AvgChargePerMonth`, was engineered by dividing `TotalCharges` by `(Tenure + 1)`. This feature aims to capture the average monthly cost for a customer, potentially offering additional predictive power.

#### How Were Existing Features Transformed?

- **Log Transformation**: Skewed numerical columns, specifically `TotalCharges` and `MonthlyCharges`, underwent a `np.log1p` transformation. This helps normalize their distributions, which can improve the performance of models sensitive to feature distribution (e.g., Logistic Regression).
- **Feature Scaling**: Numerical features (`Tenure`, `MonthlyCharges`, `TotalCharges`, and `Age` if present) were scaled using `StandardScaler`. This standardization (removing the mean and scaling to unit variance) is crucial for algorithms relying on distance metrics (e.g., KNN, Neural Networks) or gradient descent (e.g., Logistic Regression) to prevent features with larger scales from dominating the learning process.

#### Were Any Features Dropped?

The `CustomerID` column was dropped as it is a unique identifier and does not provide predictive information for customer churn.

### 5. Exploratory Data Analysis: Correlation Heatmap

#### What was the Purpose of the Correlation Heatmap?

A correlation heatmap was generated to visualize the pairwise correlation between all numerical features in the preprocessed dataset.

#### What Insights Did it Provide?

The heatmap helps in understanding the relationships between different features and the target variable (`Churn`). Strong positive or negative correlations can indicate important features and potential multicollinearity issues between independent variables.

### 6. Model Building and Evaluation

#### How Was the Data Split?

The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using `train_test_split`.

- **Features (X)**: All columns except 'Churn'.
- **Target (y)**: The 'Churn' column.
  Crucially, `stratify=y` was used to ensure that the proportion of churned and non-churned customers was maintained in both the training and test sets, which is vital for imbalanced datasets. `random_state=42` was set for reproducibility.

#### Which Models Were Initialized and Evaluated?

The following classification models were initialized and subjected to an initial evaluation:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Neural Network (MLPClassifier)

#### How Were the Models Initially Evaluated?

Each model was trained on the `X_train` and `y_train` data and then used to make predictions on the `X_test` set. The performance of each model was assessed using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correctly classified instances.
- **Precision**: Proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives (sensitivity).
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing precision and recall.

The results were compiled into a DataFrame and sorted by F1-Score in descending order to identify the best-performing model in the initial run.

#### What is Ensemble Modeling (VotingClassifier)?

An ensemble `VotingClassifier` was implemented. This model combines the predictions of multiple individual models (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost). 'Soft' voting was used, which averages the predicted probabilities from each base model, often leading to more robust and accurate predictions than individual models. The `VotingClassifier` was trained and evaluated using the same metrics.

### 7. Advanced Evaluation and Tuning

#### What is Cross-Validation and Why is it Used?

Cross-validation was demonstrated using a `RandomForestClassifier` with 5-fold cross-validation. This technique provides a more robust estimate of a model's performance by training and evaluating the model multiple times on different subsets of the data, reducing the bias that can arise from a single train-test split. The mean and standard deviation of the cross-validation scores were reported.

#### How Was Feature Importance Determined?

Feature importance was calculated using a `RandomForestClassifier`. This analysis helps identify which features contribute most significantly to the model's predictions, providing insights into the drivers of customer churn. A DataFrame was created to display features ranked by their importance.

#### What is Hyperparameter Tuning and How Was it Performed?

Hyperparameter tuning was conducted using `GridSearchCV` for the `RandomForestClassifier`.

- **What is `GridSearchCV`?**: It exhaustively searches over a specified parameter grid, evaluating all possible combinations of hyperparameters using cross-validation to find the optimal set that yields the best performance (in this case, accuracy).
- **Which Parameters Were Tuned?**: `n_estimators` (number of trees), `max_depth` (maximum depth of each tree), and `min_samples_split` (minimum samples required to split a node).
  The best parameters and the corresponding best cross-validation accuracy were reported.

#### How Were ROC Curves Used for Comprehensive Evaluation?

A `plot_roc_curves` function was defined to visualize the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve for each model.

- **What is an ROC Curve?**: It plots the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) at various threshold settings.
- **What is AUC?**: The Area Under the Curve (AUC) provides a single scalar value that summarizes the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes. A higher AUC indicates better discriminatory power.
  ROC curves were plotted for all models, including the `VotingClassifier`, to visually compare their performance and AUC scores.

#### What was the Final Evaluation Process?

A `evaluate_model` function was created to provide a comprehensive set of metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC) for any given model. This function was then used to perform a final, comprehensive evaluation of all trained models (including the `VotingClassifier`) on the test set. The results were presented in a final DataFrame, sorted by F1-Score, to provide a clear overview of each model's performance.

### 8. Conclusion

This analysis provided a structured approach to predicting customer churn, starting from raw data and progressing through detailed preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and rigorous evaluation. The use of multiple models, ensemble techniques, cross-validation, feature importance analysis, and hyperparameter tuning allowed for a robust assessment of different predictive approaches. The comprehensive evaluation metrics and ROC curve visualization provide a clear understanding of each model's strengths and weaknesses in identifying and predicting customer churn. The insights gained from feature importance can further guide business strategies for customer retention.
